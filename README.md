# Baz System
Baz system provides a toolset to help you ascertain the current state of your IT infrastructure and measure it against a desired state. This is achieved through a series of fine-grained tests that can be run on your infrastructure. The Baz system introduces a software engineering-style test-driven approach to system security by treating applications and hosts as programmable entities.

# baz-test-collection
Collections are a grouping of tests that you can run in your environment. They enable you to test an aspect of your infrastructure. For example, the active directory collection allows you to test Active Directory group policies.
